# Voyager

## A mock site to showoff the beauty and simplicity of Google's Material Design.

Whether you want to see the top of Mount Fiji, relax on a tropical beach, hike in the Sierra Nevadas, or dance in the streets of Dorne, by train, plane, car, or dragon back, voyager will get you where you want to be.

Designed by Michael Zeta and inspired by the methods outlined by Brad Traversy.
